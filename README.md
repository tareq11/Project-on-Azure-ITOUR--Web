# Project-on-Azure-ITOUR--Web
https://itour.azurewebsites.net/

This project contains a variety of technologies that we used to develop the site and bring it to the air:
1. BootStrap - is an open-source client-side environment that contains a collection of tools for creating Web applications and websites that have a huge collection of front-end Web page design CSS classes. We used BootStrap to design the site at the buttons level and to design the front end of our site.

2. CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is a design language used to describe and display a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements will be displayed on the screen, document, or any other media. It saves a lot of time by controlling multiple pages simultaneously. In this project we used CSS ready libraries from W3CSS to design the pages of the site.

3. HTML - Hypertext Markup Language is a standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. In combination with CSS and Bootstrap, we created our website using our CSS ready libraries and Font Awesome, a CSS font library to design and build our pages.

4. JQuery - jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library designed to make it easier to write scripts to the client side. jQuery was first released in 2006, and now accounts for more than 50% of the 10,000 most viewed sites, the most popular JavaScript library in use today. We used JQuery to develop Javascript to move and execute actions on a page.

5. Firebase - Firebase is a development platform for mobile and web applications. Firebase contains a real-time database as a service that allows application data to synchronize information to clients located within the cloud. We used this project as our data base to use the data contained in the site.

6. Microsoft Azure Web Sites - is a platform based on cloud computing for hosting sites is considered a platform as a service (PaaS), which allows to develop and run applications and sites without building complex infrastructure usually associated with the development of applications / sites. PaaS allows running parallel Web applications running on different systems. This project used Microsoft Azure Web Sites to host our site and database.

7. Google Maps - we're a web-based app that shows maps on aerial satellite imagery and regular maps. Enables navigation and displays business places, gas stations, etc. It contains a Google street option that is 360 Â° street photography and more. We used Google Maps for any route that directs users to the location of the site and from there they can navigate through the Google Maps app, see photos of users taken near the site, and many more.
